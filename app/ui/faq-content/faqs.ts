    question: "How far do you travel?",
    answer:
      "We're based in Rochester, NY and regularly travel to Buffalo, Syracuse, Chautauqua, Batavia, Geneseo, and throughout the Finger Lakes Region including Canandaigua, Geneva, Skaneateles, and Ithaca. We charge a moderate travel fee when going more than 45 minutes from home base.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should we do an engagement session?",
    answer:
      "We don't require an engagement session, but we recommend it because we get a chance to meet and work together before your wedding, and you'll get some practice posing! But we'll still cut the price if you don't need it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need two photographers?",
    answer:
      "We do just fine with one photographer, but a second photographer gives you more angles and more chances to catch candid moments. So you'll get more pictures and variety with two; and three is even better!",
  },
  {
    question: "What's your style?",
    answer:
      "Photo-y! We just get pictures of everything, capturing tons of candid moments without neglecting the posed photos (your mom wants them even if you don't). We edit in a clean, natural style because tastes change and highly edited photos just dated in a few years.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What happens if you get sick/die or your kids have an emergency?",
    answer:
      "We have three photographers and you're probably hiring one or two. So we can handle unexpected illness or injury. And if our kids are sick, we have an awesome and extensive and local family who watches our kids while we work, and we trust them with any emergency.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we book you?",
    answer:
      "Start with the contact form below! Then we can do a Zoom call or stick to email. To book us, complete an online contract pay us a deposit, and you're official! Then you can book your engagement session any time before the wedding. We'll get in touch about a month before the wedding to get all the good details about your itinerary.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do you charge?",
    answer: "Use the price calculator!",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we pay you?",
    answer:
      "At Bemont Photo, we always go the extra mile to get your money. So pay us however you like! We prefer Venmo, but cash, credit, and checks are fine.",
  },
  {
    question: "My venue is asking about insurance for my vendors...",
    answer:
      "No problem! We have liability insurance and will be happy to send your venue a certificate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Don't you just LOVE sparkler exits?",
    answer: "No.",
  },
  {
    question: "The garter toss is cool, though, right?",
    answer: "Yuck.",
  },
