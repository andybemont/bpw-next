  "When we got married in 2015 (before we were photographers), we had a disagreement: I felt there was no reason to spend more than $1,000 on a wedding photographer - why would it cost more? Gillian thought it would be more like $2,000. We ended up paying $3,500 for one of Rochester's best, and we left the experience thrilled with our pictures, but under the impression that apparently all wedding photographers are millionaires. Unfortunately that's definitely not true, for a few reasons.",
  "It's way more work than you might think! You see us for a few hours at your wedding, but there's also travel to and from the wedding and the many hours it takes to edit your pictures... plus we do your engagement shoot (and travel and editing for that). And that doesn't count the time spent communicating with you to make all this happen smoothly. Once you multiply all this out for two photographers, the length of the wedding is about a fifth of the total hours we'll spend on you. So our hourly income isn't nearly as juicy as you might think.",
  "It's expensive to be a photographer!​ We'll show up to your wedding with a bags containing $20,000 ​of cameras, lenses, flashes, stands, triggers, filters, memory cards, batteries, and trail mix. We have to insure it so when your fiance's degenerate third cousin with the gambling problem steals it all, we're not ruined. And of course we have to advertise, and there's the website costs, and paying to store all those pretty pictures in THE CLOUD... it adds up!",
  "You can't book that many weddings if you want to give good service. It's easy to think 'well they can do three a week, 50 weeks a year, they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars!' Well, we can't do three a week, or we'd die. Also, most weddings are on Saturdays between Memorial Day and Halloween; other dates are harder to book. So how many weddings a year? Bemont Photo aims for 25, which leaves enough time to see our kids.",
